# Introduction to Web Archiving

Content on the web is in constant flux: rapidly appearing, updating, and disappearing. 
However, many of these intentionally time-limited, spontaneous, or ephemeral cultural artifacts may hold enduring value and relevance to the historical record. 
As the web becomes the primary means of disseminating information, libraries and archives around the world are challenged with preserving this resource for current and future generations. 
As with all digital information, it is at-risk without active [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) (see [Why Digital Preservation is Important for Everyone](https://youtu.be/qEmmeFFafUs)).

An example:

Law Library of Congress [started using Perma.cc as of Oct 2015](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/04/13/law-library-of-congress-implements-solution-for-link-and-reference-rot/) (https://perma.cc/2AXT-2QKE).

- "Regulation of Drones", April 2016, <https://www.loc.gov/law/help/regulation-of-drones/index.php>. 
    - Citation on page 3: 1. ICAO, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Circular 328 AN/190 (2011), https://www.trafikstyrelsen.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/05%20Luftfart/Forum/UAS%20-%20droner/ICAO%20Circular%20328%20Unmanned%20Aircraft%20Systems%20UAS.ashx, archived at https://perma.cc/J5EM-TSAY. 
    - Citation on page 15: 1. CASA and Remotely Piloted Aircraft, CASA, https://www.casa.gov.au/aircraft/standard-page/casa-and-remotely-piloted-aircraft (last visited Apr. 4, 2016), archived at https://perma.cc/6NUC-HKK7.

## Why Web Archive?

1. Link Rot
2. Reference Rot / Content Drift

When web content changes "the citing paper is vulnerable to footnotes that no longer support its claims. This vulnerability threatens the integrity of the resulting scholarship."

Jonathan Zittrain, Kendra Albert and Lawrence Lessig, "Perma: Scoping and Addressing the Problem of Link and Reference Rot in Legal Citations", Legal Information Management, Volume 14, Issue 2 (June 2014): 88-99, http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1472669614000255 (https://perma.cc/48QZ-DT6L)


> Suppose you're a professor working on an article and you want to link to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List. Because that list changes over time, your link is going to rot and your future readers won't be able to access your actual source at the original URL. That's bad for you and your readers.
>
> But if you give Perma.cc the web address - e.g. http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten - our software will visit the page, make a record of it and give you a unique URL that points to the preserved record - e.g. perma.cc/T8U2-994F.
> 
> You can add the new Perma Link to your citation, and your future readers will be able to access the intended source no matter what happens to the original page.
