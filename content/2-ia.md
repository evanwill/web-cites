# Internet Archive

The <a href="https://archive.org/about">Internet Archive</a> has been leading the field of web archiving since 1996, developing the technical means to harvest, store, preserve, and access archived web content on a huge scale.

Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, https://archive.org/web/ 

Example: UIdaho Library website, https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.lib.uidaho.edu

For example, the <a href="{{ '/timeline.html' | relative_url }}" >U of I Library Web History Timeline</a> highlights the major redesigns over the last two decades as captured by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970218140532/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/">Internet Archive</a>. 
To provide authentic access to archived web content, the Wayback Machine renders the original functionality in the user's web browser with hyperlinks automatically redirected to archived sources rather than the live web.

If you would like to recover a broken link, please try pasting the URL in the <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a>.
