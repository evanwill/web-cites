# Internet Archive

Since 1996 the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/about) has been leading the field of web archiving since 1996, developing the technical means to harvest, store, preserve, and access archived web content on a huge scale.
The size of Internet Archive's holding are hard to imagine, with *hundreds of billions* of web pages stored and dozens of petabytes of data.

Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, https://archive.org/web/ 

submission is anonymous

Example: UIdaho Library website, https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.lib.uidaho.edu

For example, the <a href="{{ '/timeline.html' | relative_url }}" >U of I Library Web History Timeline</a> highlights the major redesigns over the last two decades as captured by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970218140532/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/">Internet Archive</a>. 
To provide authentic access to archived web content, the Wayback Machine renders the original functionality in the user's web browser with hyperlinks automatically redirected to archived sources rather than the live web.
