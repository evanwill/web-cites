# Perma.cc

developed and maintained by the [Harvard Library Innovation Lab](http://lil.law.harvard.edu/) at the Harvard Law School Library

- scholarly research citation focused
- does not crawl
- links not available via search engines

"Use it to preserve the online sources you cite and to make those records accessible to your readers."

Similar to Internet Archive ( https://archive.org/web/ ) Perma lets anyone create archival links to add to their repository because if real people are interested in the content, it probably has more value than randomly crawled links--a form of curation. Additionally, Perma provides an interface to organize and annotate links you have created (unlike Internet Archive).
