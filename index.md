# Intro to Web Archiving: Fight Link Rot and Preserve Your Citations

------

Web pages cited in your papers and used in research are in danger:

> "Over 50% of cited links in Supreme Court opinions no longer point to the intended page. Roughly 70% of cited links in academic legal journals and 20% of all science, technology and medicine articles suffer from link rot" (Perma.cc).

You can fight link rot by creating permanent archived records of web pages with Archive.org and Perma.cc. 
This workshop will introduce the issues of link rot, web archiving services, and best practices for citing web pages in your articles.
